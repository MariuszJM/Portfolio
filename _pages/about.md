Hello there,
</p>

<p>
I'm Mariusz, a Master of Science with Honors in Electrical Engineering and an AI enthusiast with over three years of experience in IT, working as a Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist. I'm passionate about data, artificial intelligence, electronics, and productivity. I consistently explore the world, and after structuring the data, I aim to act on its essence. The articles on this website are the results of that effort.
</p>

<p>
This website is a space where I share my personal thoughts, AI projects, and productivity tips.
</p>

<p>
My articles are a starting point for discussions, aimed at enhancing my understanding and argumentation skills. These writings are subjective, serving as tools for personal growth and discovery through engagement with others.
</p>

<p>
I would love to hear your thoughts, especially if they differ from mine. Looking forward to hearing from you.
</p>

<p>
Feel free to explore!
