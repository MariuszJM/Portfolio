Hello there,
</p>

<p>
I'm Mariusz and I'm passionate about data, artificial intelligence, electronics, and productivity. I consistently explore the world, and after structuring the data, I aim to act on its essence. The articles on this website are the results of that effort. This website is a space where I share my personal thoughts, AI projects, and productivity tips.
</p>

<p>
My articles are designed to spark discussions and foster growthâ€”both for myself and for others. While they aim to enhance my understanding and argumentation skills, they are also intended as tools for personal development and discovery through engagement. These writings are subjective and invite mutual growth through shared insights.
</p>

<p>
I would love to hear your perspectives, especially if they differ from mine. Looking forward to hearing from you.
</p>

<p>
Feel free to explore!
