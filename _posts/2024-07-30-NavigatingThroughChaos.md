In our rapidly changing and increasingly unstable world, the accelerating pace of digital transformation leads to a constant bombardment of information, making it easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume and speed of these changes. Therefore, it is crucial to develop more effective ways to manage and navigate this information overload.

> One promising approach is to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to filter and organize a specific domain of internet knowledge in a predictable, easy-to-interpret, and goal-oriented manner, minimizing distractions.
