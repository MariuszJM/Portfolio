In our rapidly changing and increasingly unstable world, the accelerating pace of digital transformation leads to a constant bombardment of information, making it easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume and speed of these changes. Therefore, it is crucial to develop more effective ways to manage and navigate this information overload.

> One promising approach is to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to filter and organize a specific domain of internet knowledge in a predictable, easy-to-interpret, and goal-oriented manner, minimizing distractions.

This article explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can help manage informational overload, presents my thoughts on the subject, and offers a proof of concept (PoC) for automating the exploration of new knowledge domains.


# The Bottleneck: Human Brain

Despite individual variations in intelligence, all human brains share inherent constraints that limit how quickly and efficiently we process information. These constraints include the limited capacity of short-term memory, which restricts the amount of information we can handle simultaneously, and the speed at which we can assimilate new information and transfer it to long-term memory. IQ essentially reflects these cognitive abilities. Based on current literature [reference], it is possible to prevent cognitive decline with age rather than increase IQ. Therefore, the true challenge lies in how we make the best use of the powerful machine inside our skull.

To achieve this, it is crucial to filter and structure information in a way that matches our cognitive abilities at any given moment makes learning easier and more efficient. 

To discuss further the constraints of the human brain, let's explore an ideal scenario for learning a new domain of knowledge.

Firstly, it is essential to set clear goals for your learning journey. Determine what you want to learn next. From a motivational perspective, choosing a domain that is personally significant will generate more positive emotions during the learning process compared to less significant. However, the vast array of available options can be overwhelming due to our cognitive limitations. While we can comfortably handle several options, presenting ourselves with 100 choices can be paralyzing. That’s why a tool for simplifying the decision-making process would be useful.

Once you have identified a valuable knowledge domain, it is important to approach learning hierarchically. Organizing information hierarchically reduces the demands on our short-term memory while allowing us to see the context of each piece of information. Moreover, our brains naturally organize and structure information in this manner, remembering details from general to specific [reference].

Next, consider how to spread out the learning process effectively. The first important concept is the U-curve of dopamine, which indicates that motivation tends to be highest at the beginning and end of a learning project. To leverage this, start a project that you can complete within a timeframe that sustains your initial excitement and allows you to maintain momentum as you approach the finish. For me, this optimal period is around three weeks. The second crucial element is reinforcing the acquired knowledge through spaced repetition. This method helps transfer information to long-term memory. The idea is to use the knowledge consistently over at least six weeks, reviewing it at exponentially increasing intervals, for example, after 1 day, 3 days, 9 days, and 27 days. This approach allows for partial forgetting, which makes each review session more challenging, thus supporting memorization and at the same time not requiring excessive time for revisions.

So, the ideal learning frame for me based on those constrains would be to quickly define what to learn next, which with reasonable probability is at least one of the best choices to make, explore it hierarchically from general to specific within 3 weeks, and revise several times to at least use this knowledge within 6 weeks.

# Traps of the Dynamic Digital Age

In today's digital age, platforms have become increasingly addictive, with many designed to keep users engaged for as long as possible. They often employ eye-catching images and clickbait headlines to lure users into spending more time on their site. This can lead to users, myself included, losing hours to interesting but ultimately useless content. and that could not only losing time but also overwhelming yourself with data which we don’t need It requires significant willpower to resist these temptations, and with advancing algorithms, these platforms will likely become even more addictive in the future

The ease of content generation has also exploded, leading to an overwhelming amount of information available online. As technology rapidly evolves, the rate of content production accelerates. We are caught in a positive feedback loop where each technological breakthrough speeds up the next, contributing to an ever-growing sea of information. While this might seem beneficial at first glance, providing a wealth of knowledge at our fingertips, it also presents a significant challenge.

The sheer volume of choices available to us can be paralyzing rather than empowering. With countless options to choose from, we can easily exceed our capacity to process information, leading to feelings of being overwhelmed. This phenomenon is compounded by the dynamic nature of our world, where constant technological advancements and societal changes make it increasingly difficult to keep up.

 The key to addressing these challenges lies in developing strategies to filter, organize, and prioritize information effectively, ensuring that we can focus on what truly matters without getting lost in the noise.
